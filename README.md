# VRChat AI Bot - TTS/STT System

~~A sophisticated AI companion bot for VRChat that provides real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities with intelligent conversation management and memory systems.~~
yea as if, this ai readme is a bit wrong there, this is EXTREMELY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT I DONT EVEN HAVE A GUI YET

## 🚀 Overview

This project creates an AI companion that can engage in natural conversations within VRChat environments. The system combines real-time speech processing with large language models to create an immersive, interactive experience.


### Core Components

- **Main Application** ([`Core/Main.py`](Core/Main.py:1)): Starts the bot and wires together speech, LLM, memory, and config. Early-stage orchestration; expect rough edges and breaking changes.
- **Speech Pipeline** ([`Core/Speech_To_Text.py`](Core/Speech_To_Text.py:1), [`Core/Text_To_Speech.py`](Core/Text_To_Speech.py:1)): Handles real-time STT and TTS. Currently functional but experimental
- **Conversation Logic** ([`Core/Convo_Manager.py`](Core/Convo_Manager.py:1), [`Core/Chat_Memory.py`](Core/Chat_Memory.py:1)): Manages dialogue flow and context across messages. Design is in very early stages.
- **LLM Integration** ([`Core/callLLM.py`](Core/callLLM.py:1)): Thin wrapper for OpenRouter / model calls. Subject to change as prompt format, models, and routing get refined.
- **Configuration & Devices** ([`Core/Config_Manager.py`](Core/Config_Manager.py:1), [`Core/Device_Helper.py`](Core/Device_Helper.py:1), [`Core/List_IO_indexes.py`](Core/List_IO_indexes.py:1)): Central config plus helper scripts for listing and selecting audio devices. Intended to make setup less painful, but still WIP and may require manual tweaking.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Voicemeeter Banana
- OpenRouter API key

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "tts stt ai"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Voicemeeter Banana**
    https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Configure audio devices**
   Run Audio_Setup.py and follow the instructions

   or

   set up your own audio by editing [`Core/config/config.yaml`](Core/config/config.yaml:1) to set your audio input/output device indexes:
   (you can run [`Core/List_IO_indexes.py`](Core/List_IO_indexes.py:1) to find your audio device indexes)
   


## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Open VRCHAT**

2. **Start the application**:
   Run Main.py


## 🔧 Configuration

### Audio Settings

Configure audio devices in [`Core/config/config.yaml`](Core/config/config.yaml:1):

```yaml
audio:
  input_device: 6      # Microphone device index
  output_device: 11    # Speaker device index  
  volume: 1            # TTS volume (0.0 - 1.0)
  length_scale: 1      # Speech speed (lower = faster)
  noise_scale: 0       # Voice variation
  noise_w_scale: 0     # Additional voice variation
  normalize_audio: false
```

Configure the tts voice in [`Core/config/config.yaml`](Core/config/config.yaml:1):
```yaml
TTS:
  voice: Models//glados_piper_medium.onnx
```

### AI Personality

Customize the bot's behavior in [`Core/config/vrchat_bot_prompt.md`](Core/config/vrchat_bot_prompt.md:1):

- Modify the system prompt to change personality traits
- Adjust communication style and interaction guidelines
- Set VRChat-specific knowledge and social boundaries

### AI voice

Customise the TTS voice by saving the voice .onnx and .json file in the Models folder
in config set the TTS voice to the new voice file

voices can be found here: 
https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98631?tab=files

etc, there are loads on the internet

### Common Issues

**API Connection Problems**
- Verify OpenRouter API key in .env file
- Check internet connectivity
- Monitor API rate limits and quotas
